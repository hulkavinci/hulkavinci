  - live in the UK (I often mix british & american spelling in the same sentence)
  - cosmic utilitarian (u.f is to maximise probability of human-derived consciousness going beyond type-III civilisation)
  - software engineer (background in 3d modelling and ai)
  - privacy zealot (dislike all those three letter agencies)
  - working on a haskell-based geometric kernell that could run on a distributed network (cardano)
